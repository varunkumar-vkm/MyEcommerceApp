## 🔧 Features Implemented

### Authentication
- User login and registration
- Redux state management for auth
- Mock API integration
- Form validation

### Product Management
- Product listing with search
- Product detail view
- Shopping cart functionality
- Redux state management for products

### Navigation
- Stack navigation for main flow
- Bottom tab navigation for main screens
- Conditional navigation based on auth state

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit for predictable state updates
- Async thunks for API calls
- Typed selectors and actions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install iOS dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install
   ```

3. **Start the Metro bundler**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run on iOS**:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

5. **Run on Android**:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

## 🔐 Test Credentials

For testing the login functionality, use:
- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: password

## 📱 App Flow

1. **Unauthenticated State**: Shows Login/Register screens
2. **Authenticated State**: Shows main app with:
   - Home tab: Product listing with search
   - Cart tab: Shopping cart management
   - Profile tab: User profile and logout

## 🛠 Development Notes

- The app uses mock data for development
- All API calls are mocked with realistic delays
- Redux state is properly typed with TypeScript
- Navigation is fully typed with proper screen params
- The app follows React Native best practices

## 🔄 Next Steps

To connect to a real backend:
1. Update the API base URL in `src/services/api.ts`
2. Replace mock API calls with real endpoints
3. Add proper error handling and loading states
4. Implement token refresh logic
5. Add offline support with Redux Persist

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@react-navigation/native": "^6.x.x",
  "@react-navigation/stack": "^6.x.x",
  "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.x.x",
  "react-native-screens": "^3.x.x",

  "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^2.x.x",
  "react-redux": "^9.x.x",
  "axios": "^1.x.x"
}
```

The app is now ready for development with a solid foundation of navigation, state management, and API integration!
